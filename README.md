Twitter-Mood-Analyzer
=====================

Python project that uses the Tweepy library to access Twitter's stream API to analize the mood of people's Tweets in real time and uses Pyglet to graph and display the mood of Tweets with OpenGL.

Run TwitterMoodComparison.py to compare and graph the moods of people's Tweets contaiing specified keywords over time.

Run TwitterMoodDisplay.py to artisticly display the text of random people's Tweets with their location based on the mood of the Tweet (the higher or lower the Tweet is, the more positive or negative the mood is, respectively). While the program is running, users can @mention the @DMS_423 Twitter account to be added to the whitelist and have their tweets displayed more prominently on the display.
